===========

Basic boilerplate for my needs.

Requirements

[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

Installing
-----------

Step 1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)

Step 2. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

Step 3. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/)

Step 4. Clone this depo and install all the NPM dependencies you need.

```shell
npm install
```

Step 5.
Non, you're all done!

Gulp tasks
-----------

Run Gulp tasks with either `gulp` or for a minified version meant for publish `grunt build`.


Folder structure
-------------

The development is done in `source/js/` and `source/sass/` which then will be compiled into `_build/assets/js` and `_build/assets/css`.
